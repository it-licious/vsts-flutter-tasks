# Flutter for Azure DevOps

[Flutter](http://flutter.io) build task for [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/devops/).

## Source Code

Original source code is forked from [Github](https://github.com/aloisdeniel/vsts-flutter-tasks). This repo will focus on adding functionality to tasks we need for building apps within IT Licious. Features that might seem handy for other people will be provided back to the original repo as pull requests.

## Usage

Add the tasks to your build definition in Azure Devops.

### Install

* Select the `channel`: `stable (default)`, `beta`, or `dev`.

### Build

Build the given mobile application project. You must call the `Flutter Install` task, set a `FlutterToolPath` environment variable, or use the optional Flutter SDK Path task entry that points to your `flutter/bin` folder before execution. All the application bundles are created into the `build/outputs` folder of your project.

* Select the `target` platform: `Android (default)`, `iOS`, or `All` for both.
